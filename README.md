# formal-languages-2024
My implementation of algorithms and tasks for formal languages course

NFA_dev -> branch with actual code and implementation of new features
NFA -> stable version of NFA_dev (with code review)
main -> stable branch of whole project

to start testing just install requirements.txt and run main.py

if you want test code by yourself with stdin just start parsers files manually
