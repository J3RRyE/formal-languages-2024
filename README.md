# formal-languages-2024
My implementation of algorithms and tasks for formal languages course

NFA_dev -> branch with actual code and implementation of new features
NFA -> stable version of NFA_dev (with code review)
main -> stable branch of whole project

Python version - 3.9

to start testing just install requirements.txt and run main.py:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 main.py`

if you want test code by yourself with stdin just start parsers files manually from src/*_parser.py

`python3 src/early_parser.py`

`python3 src/lr1_parser.py`
